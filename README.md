# Aurora

Conceptual protocol for decentralized communication via instant messaging and social networking.

## Rust

The reference implementation is built in Rust. We recommend using the latest nightly version of Rust
since Aurora is developed inside of it. Aurora is not targeting to compile with Rust stable.
